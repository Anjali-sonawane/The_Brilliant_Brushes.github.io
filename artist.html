Jamini Roy (11 April 1887 – 24 April 1972) was an Indian painter.<br> 
He was honoured with the State award of Padma Bhushan in 1955.<br>
He was one of the most famous pupils of Abanindranath Tagore,<br>
whose artistic originality and contribution to the emergence of modern art in India remains unquestionable.<br>
Roy began his career as a commissioned portrait painter.<br>
Somewhat abruptly in the early 1920s, he gave up commissioned portrait painting in an effort to discover his own<br>
Roy changed style from his academic Western training and featured a new style based on Bengali folk traditions.<br><br>
Roy is also described as an art machine because he produced 20,000 paintings in his lifetime which is about 10<br> 
paintings daily but made sure his artistic aims remained the same. <br>
He always targeted to the ordinary middle class as the upholder of art however he was thronged by the rich. <br>
Keeping his respect to the middle class reflected on his critical views; <br>
he believed that ordinary people were more important than governments because they were the voice of his art.<br>

The Nobel Prize in Literature 1913<br>

Born:7 May 1861, Calcutta, India<br>

Died:7 August 1941, Calcutta, India<br>
</p>
<p>
Rabindranath Tagore was the youngest son of Debendranath Tagore,<br>
a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, which was a new religious sect in nineteenth-century Bengal<br> 
and which attempted a revival of the ultimate monistic basis of Hinduism as laid down in the Upanishads.<br> 
He was educated at home; and although at seventeen he was sent to England for formal schooling,<br> <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
he did not finish his studies there. In his mature years, in addition to his many-sided literary activities,<br><
he managed the family estates, a project which brought him into close touch with common humanity and increased his interest in social reforms.<br><br>
He also started an experimental school at Shantiniketan where he tried his Upanishadic ideals of education.<br>
From time to time he participated in the Indian nationalist movement, though in his own non-sentimental and visionary way; and Gandhi,<br> 
the political father of modern India, was his devoted friend. Tagore was knighted by the ruling British Government in 1915,<br>
but within a few years he resigned the honour as a protest against British policies in India.<br>

<br>
Tagore had early success as a writer in his native Bengal.<br>
 With his translations of some of his poems he became rapidly known in the West.<br> 
 In fact his fame attained a luminous height, taking him across continents on lecture tours and tours of friendship.<br>
 For the world he became the voice of India’s spiritual heritage; and for India, especially for Bengal, he became a great living institution.<br>

Raja Ravi Varma was a celebrated Indian painter and artist.<br>
 He is considered among the greatest painters in the history of Indian art<br>
 for a number of aesthetic and broader social reasons. <br>

 the fusion of European techniques with a purely Indian sensibility.
While continuing the tradition and aesthetics of Indian art,<br>
 his paintings employed the latest European academic art techniques of the day.<br>
 Secondly, he was notable for making affordable lithographs of <br>
 his paintings available to the public, which greatly enhanced his reach <br>
